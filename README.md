# Chat Bot 

A simple application for a Travel Bot built using Tkinter in Python.

## Features

- Basic chat interface with the Travel Bot
- Responses based on predefined patterns (rather than using external libraries like chatter bot, i use vanilla python because I believe this makes the bot response more accurately.)
- Utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface

# Usage

1. run python bot.py
2. Enter your messages in the input field.
3. Click the "Send" button.
4. The Travel Bot will respond based on predefined patterns.
